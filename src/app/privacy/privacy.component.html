            This privacy policy ("Policy") explains our policy regarding
            the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of your
            information by RTBAnalytica and/or its subsidiary(ies) and/or

            information, products, offerings and content via any mobile or
            internet connected device or otherwise (collectively the

            Use and other terms on the Site ("Terms of Use"). Capitalized

            wherever the context so requires "you" or "your" shall mean

      <h2>A. INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY USERS</h2>
      <div>
        <h5>Registration data:</h5>
        <p>
          When you register on the Sites for the Service, we ask that you
          to provide basic contact information such as your name, sex,
          age, address, pin code, contact number, occupation, interests
          and email address etc. When you register using your other
          accounts like on Facebook, Twitter, Gmail etc. we shall retrieve
          Information from such accounts to continue to interact with you
          and to continue providing the Services.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>Voluntary information:</h5>
        <p>
          We may collect additional information at other times, including
          but not limited to, when you provide feedback, comments, change
          your content or email preferences, respond to a survey, or any
          communications with us.
        </p>

      <h2>
        B. INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED/ TRACKED WHILE NAVIGATION
      </h2>
      <div>
        <h5>Cookies:</h5>
        <p>
          To improve the responsiveness of the Sites for our Users, we may
          use "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect
          Information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a
          User Identification (User ID) to understand the User's
          individual interests using the identified computer or device.
          Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration,
          for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even
          if we assign a cookie to your computer or device. The only
          personal information a cookie can contain is information you
          supply. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive or device.
          Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your
          browser (if you click on their ads etc.), a process that we do
          not control. We receive and store certain types of Information
          whenever you interact with us via Site or Service though your
          computer/laptop/netbook or mobile/tablet/pad/handheld device
          etc.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>Opting Out:</h5>
        <p>
          If a User opts out using the Ads Settings, the unique
          DoubleClick cookie ID on the User's browser is overwritten with
          the phrase "OPT_OUT". Because there is no longer a unique cookie
          ID, the opt-out cookie can't be associated with a particular
          browser.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>Log File Information:</h5>
        <p>
          We automatically collect limited information about your
          computer's connection to the Internet, mobile number, including
          your IP address, when you visit our site, application or
          service. Your IP address is a number that lets computers
          attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as
          the pages you view. We automatically receive and log information
          from your browser, including your IP address, your computer's
          name, your operating system, browser type and version, CPU
          speed, and connection speed. We may also collect log information
          from your device, including your location, IP address, your
          device's name, device's serial number or unique identification
          number (e.g.. UDiD on your iOS device), your device operating
          system, browser type and version, CPU speed, and connection
          speed etc.

      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>Clear GIFs</h5>
        <p>
          We may use "clear GIFs" (Web Beacons) to track the online usage
          patterns of our Users in an anonymous manner, without personally
          identifying the User. We may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based
          emails sent to our Users to track which emails are opened by
          recipients. We use this information to inter-alia deliver our
          web pages to you upon request, to tailor our Sites or Service to
          the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our Sites
          to improve the quality, functionality and interactivity of our
          Sites and let advertisers know the geographic locations from
          where our Users come without personally identifying the Users.

          communications and promotions. We use Google Analytics, among
          others, to track the user behaviour on our Sites. Google
          Analytics specifically has been enabled to support display
          advertising towards helping us gain understanding of our users'
          demographics and interests. The reports are anonymous and cannot
          be associated with any individual personally identifiable
          information that you may have shared with us. You can opt-out of
          Google Analytics for display advertising and customize Google
          Display Network ads using the Ads Settings options provided by

        </p>
        <p>
          When we present Information to our advertisers -- to help them
          understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on
          our Sites -- it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics
          on traffic to various pages / content within our Sites. We use
          third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit
          our Sites. These companies may use Information (excluding your

          personally identifiable information) about your visits to this
          and other websites or application, in order to provide

          The information as supplied by the users enables us to improve
          the Services and provide you the most user-friendly experience.
          In some cases/provision of certain service(s) or utility(ies),
          we may require your contact address as well. All required
          Information is service dependent and the Company may use the
          above said user Information to, maintain, protect, and improve
          the Services (including advertising and personalisation on the
          Sites) and for developing new services. We may also use your

          send commercial or marketing messages about our Services and/or
          such additional updates and features about third parties
          products and services with an option to subscribe / unsubscribe

        <p>
          Any personally identifiable information provided by you will not

          In case you choose to decline to submit personally identifiable
          information on the Sites, we may not be able to provide certain
          services on the Sites to you. We will make reasonable efforts to
          notify you of the same at the time of opening your account. In
          any case, we will not be liable and or responsible for the
          denial of certain services to you for lack of you providing the
          necessary personal information.

        <h2>4. INFORMATION SHARING</h2>

          The Company shares your Information with any third party without
          obtaining the prior consent of the User in the following limited
          circumstances:
        </p>
        <p>
          a) When it is requested or required by law or by any court or
          governmental agency or authority to disclose, for the purpose of
          verification of identity, or for the prevention, detection,
          investigation including but not limited to cyber incidents, or
          for prosecution and punishment of offences. These disclosures
          are made in good faith and belief that such disclosure is
          reasonably necessary for enforcing these Terms or for complying
          with the applicable laws and regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          b) The Company proposes to share such Information to conduct its
          business and to share such Information within its group
          companies and officers and employees of such group companies for
          the purpose of processing personal information on its behalf. We
          also ensure that these recipients of such Information agree to
          process such information based on our instructions and in
          compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate
          confidentiality and security measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          c) The Company may present Information to our advertisers and
          third parties - to help them understand our audience and confirm
          the value of advertising on our Sites – however it is usually in
          the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages
          within our site.
        </p>
        <p>
          d) The Company may share your Information regarding your
          activities on Sites with third party social websites to populate
          your social wall that is visible to other people however you
          will have an option to set your privacy settings, where you can
          decide what you would like to share or not to share with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          e) We may share your Information to enforce or protect our
          rights or any or all of its affiliates, associates, employees,
          directors or officers or when we have reason to believe that
          disclosing Information of User(s) is necessary to identify,
          contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing
          interference with our rights or our Sites, whether intentionally
          or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such
          activities
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>5. ACCESSING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
          When you use the Services or Sites (or any of its sub sites), we
          make good faith efforts to provide you, as and when requested by
          you, with access to your personal information and shall further
          ensure that any personal information or sensitive personal data
          or information found to be inaccurate or deficient shall be
          corrected or amended as feasible, subject to any requirement for
          such personal information or sensitive personal data or
          information to be retained by law or for legitimate business
          purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the
          information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed
          before processing such requests, and we may decline to process
          requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require
          disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of
          others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance,
          requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or
          for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where
          we provide information access and correction, we perform this
          service free of charge, except if doing so would require a
          disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain
          services and/or due to requirements under applicable laws for
          retaining or preserving information, after you delete your
          information, such information and/or residual copies may take a
          period of time before they are deleted from our active servers
          and may remain in our backup systems.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>6. INFORMATION SECURITY</h2>
        <p>
          We take appropriate security measures to protect against
          unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
          destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data
          collection, storage and processing practices and security
          measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security
          measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where
          we store personal data. All information gathered on TIL is
          securely stored within the Company controlled database. The
          database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access
          to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited.
          However, as effective as our security measures are, no security
          system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our
          database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will
          not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the
          Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a
          posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with
          Internet access.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you
          visit or use our Sites or Services. These companies may use
          information (excluding your name, address, email address or
          telephone number or any personally identifiable information)
          about your visits or use to particular website, mobile
          application or services, in order to provide advertisements
          about goods and services of interest to you.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>7. UPDATES / CHANGES</h2>
        <p>
          The internet is an ever evolving medium. We may alter our Policy
          from time to time to incorporate necessary changes in
          technology, applicable law or any other variant. In any case, we
          reserve the right to change (at any point of time) the terms of
          this Policy or the Terms of Use. Any changes we make will be
          effective immediately on notice, which we may give by posting
          the new policy on the Sites . Your use of the Sites or Services
          after such notice will be deemed acceptance of such changes. We
          may also make reasonable efforts to inform you via electronic
          mail. In any case, you are advised to review this Policy
          periodically on the Sites to ensure that you are aware of the
          latest version.
